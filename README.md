## How do I get started?

* Install [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/ "Python 3.6 Download") (suggested, any 3.x version *should* work, **APART FROM 3.8 DO NOT USE 3.8 OR ELSE YOU'LL GET A LOT OF ERRORS**.)


* Then, if you're on Windows run ``INSTALL PACKAGES.bat``. Any other OSes, these commands into terminal.
```
python3 -m pip install -U -r requirements.txt
```

Then fill out ``config.json`` with your configuration & run the fortnite.py file!
